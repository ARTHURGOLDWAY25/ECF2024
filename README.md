## Project Overview

This project incorporates a variety of technologies to create a dynamic and responsive web application:

- **Backend:**
  - **PHP:** Utilized for server-side scripting and handling backend logic.
  - **MySQL (JawsDB):** Integrated as a relational database for managing contact form submissions.
  - **MongoDB Atlas:** Used as a NoSQL database to store user data related to the "Events" section under the "Visitor Feedback" dropdown menu. This section is accessible from the Home, Gallery, and Contact pages.

- **Additional Features:**
  - **Gallery Section:** Includes a click counter implemented with PHP to track the number of clicks on each image. The click data is stored on a local MongoDB server running on port 27017.
